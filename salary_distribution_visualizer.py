# Visualization Write-Up â€“ Larbi Moukhlis
# For this assignment, I created two types of visualizations using Seaborn
# to analyze data from the City of Chicago salaries dataset:
#
# 1. Barplot and Boxplot Combination:
#    This visualization compares the average annual salary across the top six
#    departments with the highest number of employees. The barplot provides a
#    view of which departments offer higher average compensation, while the boxplot
#    reveals the spread and distribution of salaries within each department,
#    highlighting medians, variability, and outliers.
#
# 2. Histogram with KDE (Kernel Density Estimate):
#    The second visualization displays the distribution of all annual salaries
#    in the dataset. The histogram shows the frequency of different salary ranges,
#    and the KDE overlay helps visualize the shape of the distribution. This plot
#    shows a right-skewed distribution, indicating that most employees earn moderate
#    salaries while a smaller group earns significantly higher wages.
#
# These visualizations provide insight into salary disparities across departments
# and the overall distribution of compensation among city employees. They help
# identify trends and areas for further analysis.
