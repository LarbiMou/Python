Academic Data Analysis Projects
Author: Larbi Moukhlis

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts for data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization, developed as part of an advanced data science course. Projects range from basic descriptive statistics to API-driven data aggregation and regression modeling, with a focus on real-world datasets (e.g., Chicago city salaries, transportation metrics).

Project Overview
1. Grade Distribution Analysis
File: grade_distribution_analyzer.py

Description: Compares user-input grades against class statistics (min, median, max) and evaluates proximity to the median using nested conditionals.

Key Techniques: List operations, descriptive statistics, user input validation.

2. Salary Data Cleaning Pipeline
File: salary_data_cleaning_pipeline.py

Description: Cleans and transforms a CSV of employee salaries by filtering invalid entries, converting data types, and generating dummy variables for categorical departments.

Key Techniques: Pandas data wrangling, pd.to_numeric(), pd.get_dummies().

3. Police Salary API Aggregation
File: police_salary_api_aggregator.py

Description: Queries the Chicago Data Portal API to aggregate average salaries for police roles using SoQL, then saves results to JSON.

Key Techniques: API requests (requests), SoQL filtering, pandas aggregation (groupby).

4. Salary Regression Modeling
File: salary_regression_analysis.py

Description: Analyzes salary disparities between police/non-police departments using OLS and logistic regression (statsmodels).

Key Techniques: Dummy variable creation, regression diagnostics, interpretation of p-values/RÂ².

5. Salary Distribution Visualization
File: salary_distribution_visualizer.py

Description: Generates comparative visualizations (barplots, boxplots, histograms) of salary distributions across Chicago city departments using seaborn.

Key Techniques: Data filtering, KDE plots, multi-panel figures (plt.subplot()).

Key Insights
Policy Implications: Regression models (Lab 4) reveal significant salary gaps for police vs. non-police roles.

Data Quality: Lab 2 highlights challenges in cleaning real-world salary data (e.g., null values, mixed types).

Visual Trends: Lab 5 identifies right-skewed salary distributions and departmental outliers.
